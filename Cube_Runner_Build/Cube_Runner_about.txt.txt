I developed "Cube Runner," a beginner-friendly runner game where a cube navigates through obstacles.
This project was a hands-on learning experience in game development.

Details:-
> Role: Sole Developer
> Objective: To create a functional runner game and apply my development skills practically.
> Technologies Used: Unity Engine, C#
> Learning Source: YouTube course references

> Challenges: As my first game, understanding the intricacies of game development was challenging. However, perseverance 
              and dedication led to successful completion.
> Outcome: The game features decent graphics and good color contrast. Despite initial hurdles, the project was a significant 
           learning experience, and I plan to improve the game in future iterations.
